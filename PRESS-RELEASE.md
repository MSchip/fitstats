# FitStats: Unify Your Fit Life
###Finally, a unified source to collect, track, and analyze all your fitness data.

*July 9, 2014*

FitStats is a web and mobile application aimed towards fitness enthusiasts wanting to unify all their fitness data. With all the new entrants to the “wearables” and fitness tracking services such as Fitbit, Jawbone Up, MyFitnessPal, and MyPlate - data fragmentation is an increasingly large problem - with users having accounts across multiple services.

FitStats ends this fragmentation nightmare by allowing you, the user, to link up your favorite fitness apps and services, and have your data automatically pulled into one convenient dashboard. FitStats also gives you a convenient panel to enter and track any custom data you want. From there, you can track your progress, gain new insights into your fitness with custom reports, and export your data for safe-keeping.

*“We at FitStats are ecstatic to introduce a new way for fitness enthusiasts to unify all the fitness data they want. With FitStats, instead of spending all your time entering data into spreadsheets,  you can do the things that matter - living a fit, healthy, and happy life.” - Andrew Zey, Product Owner*

Getting started is easy. Just sign up for a free FitStats account, link up your existing apps and services (Fitbit, Up, etc.), and toss all the spreadsheets!

*“As a professional figure competitor, I need to be able to correlate different types of data so I can make sure I get the best results possible. Before FitStats, I logged all my food in MyFitnessPal, copied my calorie totals and nutrient information into a spreadsheet, and logged all my weight and body fat numbers in another. With FitStats, I can now collect all my data and analyze it in one place and spend my time training instead of typing!” - Jane Doe, Figure Competitor*
